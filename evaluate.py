# Evaluate my text
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now that we have our decoding method defined, we can write functions for
# evaluating a string input sentence. The ``evaluate`` function manages
# the low-level process of handling the input sentence. We first format
# the sentence as an input batch of word indexes with *batch_size==1*. We
# do this by converting the words of the sentence to their corresponding
# indexes, and transposing the dimensions to prepare the tensor for our
# models. We also create a ``lengths`` tensor which contains the length of
# our input sentence. In this case, ``lengths`` is scalar because we are
# only evaluating one sentence at a time (batch_size==1). Next, we obtain
# the decoded response sentence tensor using our ``GreedySearchDecoder``
# object (``searcher``). Finally, we convert the response’s indexes to
# words and return the list of decoded words.
#
# ``evaluateInput`` acts as the user interface for our chatbot. When
# called, an input text field will spawn in which we can enter our query
# sentence. After typing our input sentence and pressing *Enter*, our text
# is normalized in the same way as our training data, and is ultimately
# fed to the ``evaluate`` function to obtain a decoded output sentence. We
# loop this process, so we can keep chatting with our bot until we enter
# either “q” or “quit”.
#
# Finally, if a sentence is entered that contains a word that is not in
# the vocabulary, we handle this gracefully by printing an error message
# and prompting the user to enter another sentence.
